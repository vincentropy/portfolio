# Portfolio - @vincentropy

This portfolio showcases recent projects I've been working on. You can find the live version on github pages.

I wanted to create with a minimalist but flexible layout design that works on both mobile and desktop. I also experiment with just-in-time loading of components without causing page jitter.

## Stack in this project

- React
- MUI
- github pages
- github CI/CD
- react-markdown
  - some custom parsing of markdown to create preview cards
